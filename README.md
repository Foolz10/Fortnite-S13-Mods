# Fortnite-S13-Mods
Fortnite mods for Android and IOS

These mods are mainly for S13 Android; they also work on iOS. These mods are mainly dance swaps and skin swaps. Also, the playlist mod is for all the gamemodes to appear. Here's a tutorial if you do not know how to set up the mods. Watch the video. 

If your device downloads additional content, do the same instead of replacing all the Lang .paks, replace the Langde and Langdeoptional .Paks!

FAQ:
